#Quikr

Quikr is a QUadratic, Iterative, K-mer based Reconstruction technique that utilizes sparsity promoting ideas from the field of compressed sensing to reconstruct the composition of a bacterial community (when the input data is 454-like pyrosequencing data). This extremely fast method comes with a several databases that can be custom trained. Typically reconstruction is accurate down to the genus level.
